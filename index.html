    <h2 id="article">Main Article</h2>
    <div class="box" id="article-text">

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
    Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles (AVs), are reshaping the automotive industry. 
    Companies such as Tesla, Waymo and Mercedes already offer cars with different levels of automation, 
    and fully self-driving vehicles aim to handle every driving task from steering and braking to navigating 
    junctions and reacting to sudden hazards.
    </p>

    <p>
    To achieve this level of independence, AVs must behave like human drivers. 
    They need to sense their surroundings, interpret what they see and make safe, informed decisions. 
    This article explains how self-driving cars work and the engineering technologies that enable them.
    </p>

    <h3>How Self-Driving Cars “See” the World</h3>
    <p>Autonomous vehicles rely on several types of sensors, each offering unique strengths, much like how humans use multiple senses.</p>

    <p><b>1. Cameras — Human-Like Vision</b><br>
    Cameras act as the vehicle’s eyes, capturing detailed images used to detect traffic lights, read road signs, follow lane markings 
    and recognise pedestrians, cyclists and other road users. Deep learning algorithms analyse this visual data almost instantly.
    </p>

    <p><b>2. LiDAR — Building a 3D Map</b><br>
    LiDAR sends out rapid laser pulses and measures how long they take to return, producing an accurate 3D map of the environment. 
    It provides precise distance measurements, clear object shapes and reliable performance in low light.
    </p>

    <p><b>3. Radar — Tracking Speed and Distance</b><br>
    Radar uses radio waves to measure how fast objects are moving and how far away they are. 
    It performs well in fog, rain or darkness and is essential for detecting vehicle speed and distance.
    </p>

    <p><b>4. Ultrasonic Sensors — Close-Range Detection</b><br>
    Ultrasonic sensors help with low-speed manoeuvres like parking by detecting curbs, walls and other nearby objects through sound waves.
    </p>

    <h3>Sensor Fusion: A Clearer Picture</h3>
    <p>
    Each sensor has limitations, so self-driving cars use sensor fusion combining data from cameras, radar, LiDAR and ultrasonics 
    into one reliable model of the surroundings. This constantly updated digital map allows the vehicle to understand road layout, 
    traffic signals, object positions and potential hazards, enabling smooth and safe movement.
    </p>

    <h3>How Self-Driving Cars Make Decisions</h3>
    <p>Once a car understands its environment, it must decide how to act. This involves three main systems.</p>

    <p><b>1. Perception</b><br>
    Perception algorithms interpret sensor data to recognise vehicles, pedestrians, animals, lane markings and signs. 
    These systems use deep neural networks trained on large amounts of driving data.
    </p>

    <p><b>2. Prediction</b><br>
    Prediction systems anticipate what other road users might do next whether a pedestrian will cross, 
    a cyclist will turn or a car ahead might brake suddenly. Predicting human behaviour remains one of the hardest 
    challenges in autonomous driving.
    </p>

    <p><b>3. Planning and Control</b><br>
    The planning system selects a safe path based on predictions, while the control system executes it through steering, 
    braking and acceleration. Together, they ensure the ride feels safe and natural.
    </p>

    <h3>Engineering Challenges</h3>
    <p>Despite rapid progress, several barriers still limit widespread deployment.</p>

    <p><b>1. Weather</b><br>
    Rain, fog and snow can interfere with sensors by creating reflections, reducing visibility or scattering LiDAR signals. 
    When sensor data becomes unreliable, decision-making becomes more difficult.
    </p>

    <p><b>2. Unpredictable Human Behaviour</b><br>
    People don’t always act predictably pedestrians might cross suddenly or drivers may ignore rules. 
    Teaching a car to anticipate such behaviour is extremely complex.
    </p>

    <p><b>3. Computing Power</b><br>
    Autonomous vehicles process huge amounts of data every second. Their onboard computers generate significant heat, 
    and managing this inside a compact car poses engineering challenges.
    </p>

    <p><b>4. Legal and Ethical Issues</b><br>
    Questions about responsibility in accidents and how cars should behave in unavoidable situations are still being debated. 
    Laws differ between countries and continue to evolve.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Progress and Real-World Deployment</h3>
    <p>Several companies have already introduced autonomous systems on public roads:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Waymo operates fully driverless taxis in parts of the United States.</li>
    <li>Mercedes offers a certified Level 3 system in Germany and some U.S. states, allowing drivers to take their eyes off the road under certain conditions.</li>
    <li>Tesla provides advanced driver-assistance features, though they still require active supervision.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    While these systems aren’t perfect, improvements in AI, computing and sensors are steadily pushing the industry closer to full autonomy.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Directions</h3>

    <p><b>1. Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication</b><br>
    Cars will share information about hazards, weather and traffic, helping them react faster and improving overall safety.
    </p>

    <p><b>2. Smarter AI</b><br>
    Advanced neural networks may allow AVs to reason more effectively, manage rare situations and make decisions that resemble human judgement.
    </p>

    <p><b>3. Improved Sensors</b><br>
    New solid-state LiDAR and other compact, durable sensors will reduce costs and make autonomous systems more accessible.
    </p>

    <p><b>4. Connected Infrastructure</b><br>
    Future roads and traffic systems may communicate with vehicles, leading to smoother traffic flow and fewer accidents.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    Self-driving cars combine sophisticated sensors, artificial intelligence and powerful computing to understand their surroundings 
    and navigate without human control. Although challenges like weather, unpredictable behaviour and ethical concerns remain, 
    continuous advancements are bringing fully autonomous travel closer to becoming part of everyday life. As technology improves, 
    self-driving cars may offer safer roads, reduced congestion and more efficient transportation for everyone.
